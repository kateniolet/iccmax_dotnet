Unofficial port of the ICC 2:2003 standard to C#
See https://github.com/InternationalColorConsortium/DemoIccMAX

This project aims to be a straight-as-possible port of the original C++ code C#
Wherever possible function names, type names, etc match the original - even when this goes against C# convention.
